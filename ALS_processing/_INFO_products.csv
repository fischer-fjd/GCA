chm_highest.tif,"Canopy height model (CHM). Canopy height estimates based on highest return per pixel (typical resolution: 1 m2), relative to ground elevation. Computed as dsm_highest.tif - dtm.tif. Useful for homogeneous, high-quality scans (>= 30 pulses per m2) and individual tree crown delineations. Not recommended for comparative analyses across time or space with varying scanning properties. Cf. recommendations in: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14416, in particular Fig. 4."
chm_lspikefree.tif,"Canopy height model (CHM). Canopy height estimates based on locally adaptive spikefree algorithm applied to first returns, relative to ground elevation. Computed as dsm_lspikefree.tif - dtm.tif. Maximally robust CHM that creates a spikefree interpolation of top canopy height while adjusting to local variation in pulse density. Recommended for comparative analyses across time and space. Applicable down to densities of 2-3 pulses per m2. Limited use for individual tree delineation due to smoothing of edges. Cf. recommendations in: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14416, in particular Fig. 4."
chm_tin.tif,"Canopy height model (CHM). Canopy height estimates based on Delaunay-triangulation of first returns, relative to ground elevation. Computed as dsm_tin.tif - dtm.tif. Robust to point cloud density variation, but usually full of pits and spikes. Interpretable as the mean height of light interception within the canopy. Useful in conjunction with locally adaptive spikefree CHM. Cf. recommendations in: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14416, in particular Fig. 4."
classification_supplied.tif,"Rasterized point cloud classifications as supplied by data provider. Useful to check for special noise classifications that may have been overlooked, or for further downstream analysis (exclusion of buildings). The default LAStools rasterization choice (class of highest point) is used."
dsm_highest.tif,"Digital surface model (DSM). Surface height estimates based on highest return per pixel (typical resolution: 1 m2). Useful for homogeneous, high-quality scans (>= 30 pulses per m2) and individual tree crown delineations. Not recommended for comparative analyses across time or space with varying scanning properties. Cf. recommendations in: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14416, in particular Fig. 4."

Maximally robust DSM that creates a spikefree interpolation of top surface height while adjusting to local variation in pulse density. Recommended for comparative analyses across time and space. Applicable down to densities of 2-3 pulses per m2. Limited use for individual tree delineation due to smoothing of edges.

dtm_highest.tif,"Digital terrain model (DTM). Elevation estimates based on highest ground return per pixel (typical resolution: 1 m2). Not interpolated and therefore not useful for terrain or canopy modelling. Useful for quality checks, e.g. to identify large areas without ground points."
dtm_lasdef.tif,Digital terrain model (DTM). Default LAStools digital terrain model. Computed from default ground classification with lasground_new and Delaunay-triangulation with las2dem. Useful as baseline and for comparisons across datasets.
dtm_lasfine.tif,"Digital terrain model (DTM). Refined DTM, created in LAStools with more sensitive parameters (-step 10 -bulge 1.0 -hyper_fine). Useful in conjunction with dtm_lasdef.tif to assess robustness of ground modelling."
dtm_supplied.tif,"Digital terrain model (DTM). DTM supplied by data provider. May not exist. Useful for quality checks, as supplied DTMs often (but not always!) contain manual corrections."
dtm.tif,"Digital terrain model (DTM). The default terrain model used by the processing pipeline. Based on the default LAStools lasground_new classification, but refined to improve accuracy in steep areas. Areas with a slope >= 40 degrees are processed with options -bulge 3.0 -ultra_fine, and areas with slope >= 60 are processed with -nature -ultra_fine. In addition, point clouds are rotated 8 times in 45 degree angles, tilted each time (by 20 and 30 degrees, respectively) and then reclassified."
mask_cloud.tif,"Mask layer for cloud regions. At the end of processing, if any points remain within 1 m of the upper limit of canopy height (typically 125 m), they and the immediate area surrounding them are masked out by this layer (set to NA). This will also mask dense high noise that automatic noise filters have missed, and DTM artefacts around inaccurately rendered cliffs. This mask is included in mask_combined.tif and should always be applied."
mask_combined.tif,"Mask layer that combines several other masks, including: mask_cloud.tif, mask_noground.tif, mask_pd02.tif. This is a minimum mask to improve robustness of the inferred terrain and canopy models. Consider combining this layer with mask_steep.tif or mask_unstabledtm.tif for maximum robustness."
mask_noground.tif,"Mask layer for regions of the point cloud devoid of ground points. Any areas that do not have any ground points within a circle of radius 15 m are masked out by this layer (set to NA). Can indicate areas of poor sampling such as in low-quality point clouds of dense forest canopies, or inaccurate DTM modelling, e.g. mountain spurs that have been cut off.  This mask is included in mask_combined.tif and should always be applied."
mask_unstabledtm.tif,"Mask layer for regions of the point cloud where the DTM varies depending on which algorithm is used. Computed as areas where dtm_lasdef.tif and dtm_lasfine.tif differ by more than 2 m  after smoothing them with a circle of 10 m radius. Can be used to improve robustness, but may discard perfectly valid high-elevation or rugged regions."
mask_pd02.tif,"Mask layer for regions of the point cloud with very low pulse density. Masks out all areas with pulse densities < 2 pulses per m2 (set to NA). This mask is included in mask_combined.tif and should always be applied. Cf. recommendations in: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14416, in particular Fig. 4."
mask_pd04.tif,"Mask layer for regions of the point cloud with low pulse density. Masks out all areas with pulse densities < 4 pulses per m2 (set to NA). Can be used to improve robustness of inference in dense canopies, but may discard perfectly valid regions. Cf. recommendations in: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14416, in particular Fig. 4."
mask_steep.tif,"Mask layer for steep regions of the point cloud where the DTM varies depending on which algorithm is used. Computed as areas where dtm.tif and dtm_lasdef.tif differ by more than 0.5 m after smoothing them with a circle of 10 m radius. Can be used to improve robustness, but may discard perfectly valid high-elevation or rugged regions."
