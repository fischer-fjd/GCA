### GCA
Processing functions for Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and the Global Canopy Atlas (GCA).

### SOFTWARE 
The pipeline is dependent on LAStools (https://rapidlasso.de). For most use cases, this requires a license (cf. https://rapidlasso.de/pricing/). Always use the most recent version of the pipeline and download a recent version of LAStools before processing. When systematic processing errors occur, it's useful to try both the most recent and a slightly older version of LAStools to rule out issues due to a recent update.
